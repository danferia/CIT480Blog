<blockquote>
  <p>With every advancement there are challenges which we face with the limitation, errors, and complications. The traditional on-premise computing done via local server, or a personal computer are now being left behind over the decade. With a study done by the Enterprise Cloud Computing Survey is was found that seventy-three percent of organizations have one application with cloud computing infrastructure. This study may have increased because of the pandemic many organizations working from home using a cloud service which allow groups of an organization to stay connected. With the variety of service, tools, and data virtualization systems which all need to be stored there are security, cost management and containment, lack of resources, control, compliance, management of multiple clouds, performance, building private clouds, segmented usage, migration that all caused issues. Below I will discuss some topics I find important.</p>
  <h3 id="security-issues">Security Issues</h3>
  <p>There are many concerns for security risks with cloud computing which has been the top concern in 2018 as the lack of resources and expertise has made some businesses vulnerable. Most cloud providers have a basic security process which can provide some validity however the risk has increase overtime. Some of the most highlighted risks are data breaches, compromised credentials, and broken authentication. These risks have made trusting third party services very hard. Some of the solutions are having an third party audit to comply with standards and regulations. These require applying database privacy security laws checking users authentication, access control, and user ID management.</p>
  <h3 id="lack-of-resources-and-expertise">Lack of Resources and Expertise</h3>
  <p>There is a major lack of expertise and resources with cloud services as organizations are increasing their cloud use. The IT staff must be trained and adopt methods which will help them manage effectively schedule policies important for high scalability and operational efficiency. With IaaS providers which rely on either static VM provisioning policies to allocate physical resources, dynamic policies which handles load variations and other load balancing techniques. Many of these policies include have a level of techniques which auto-scale dynamic resources, resource throttling, admission control methods, and multi cloud load balancers which spread the load across multiple Cloud data centers (CDCs) applications.</p>
  <h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
  <p>Across all types of cloud computing there have neem multiple challenges with companies shifting or combining public and private clouds. Public cloud infrastructure has evolved as service providers have increased their offerings while continuing incorporating state-of-the-art hardware to meet customer standards. As businesses have come to rely on service providers the next challenge came with expanding on innovative technologies because when the provider is down so is everything in the business. There also needs to be an application which is compatible with these resources and the workload. There is a gap between hardware accelerators and high-level programing can make things difficult for cloud software to maximize performance.</p>
