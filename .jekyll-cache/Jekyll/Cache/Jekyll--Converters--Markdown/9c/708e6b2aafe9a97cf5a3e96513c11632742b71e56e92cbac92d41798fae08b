<blockquote>
  <p>There are three generalized types of cloud computing which have helped evolve the type of environments that exist now. There is public, private and hybrid cloud computing each allow basic infrastructure resources across deployment models but with different allocation between users. With Public cloud it is delivered via the internet and shared across organizations and is managed by the vendor. Private cloud is dedicated solely to an organization or individual user. Hybrid is used in both public and private clouds which allows it to be portable and flexible. All of these have evolve to not different models which are becoming more independent off of the physical servers and data centers making room for virtualization technology.</p>
  <h2 id="the-three-basic-model-types">The Three Basic Model Types</h2>
  <h3 id="public-cloud">Public Cloud</h3>
  <p>Public Cloud is a service delivered via the internet it is the most popular model of cloud computing. the most defining features of public cloud is its high elasticity and scalability, the users may pay a low-cost subscription-based price tier for the service. The cloud vendor is responsible for developing, managing, and maintaining the resources share between multiple tenants across the network. It is most suitable in types of environments which it can be used for communication with a specific number of users. There are additional resources which are used in software development and test the environments.</p>
  <h3 id="private-cloud">Private Cloud</h3>
  <p>Private cloud is dedicated for the use of a single organization and doesnâ€™t share computing resources with other organizations. Data centers are located on-premise or operated offsite by a third party which makes it isolated and delivered to a secure network and not shared with customers. Because private cloud is customizable the organization can control the infrastructure without compromising security performance on the dedicated data centers. Private cloud is used by industries and government agencies which is means that they are highly regulated for the sensitive data that is stored.</p>
  <h3 id="hybrid-cloud">Hybrid Cloud</h3>
  <p>Hybrid cloud infrastructure is combined by both public and private cloud solutions resources are integrated in the environment. Applications and data workloads may chare resources between public and private cloud deployments based on policies like security, performance, scalability, cost, and efficiency. One of the most common examples is organizations use private cloud environments for IT workloads and the infrastructure of public cloud resources. With hybrid cloud organizations can serve multiple security, regulatory, and performance requirements with existing cloud solutions. Their private security network can also be improved with Software as a Service.</p>
