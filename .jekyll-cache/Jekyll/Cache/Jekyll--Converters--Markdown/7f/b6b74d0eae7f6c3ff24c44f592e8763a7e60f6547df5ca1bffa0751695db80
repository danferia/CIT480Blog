<blockquote>
  <p>Cloud computing has allowed users to work at any location and because of the sensitive data most people hold security has been the main concern. The primary service models such as software as a service, platform as a service, and infrastructure as a service each of these service models have their own vulnerabilities. There are several approaches developed to investigate the threats, vulnerabilities, and security issues. The many service-delivery models have a security issue which doesnâ€™t target all security aspects in each model. One of the main concerns for these models are data leakages, end to end encryption, virtual network, virtual storage and shared virtual infrastructures because the standard network protocol cloud-computing offers to be exposed to similar and major security threats with new ones being created.</p>
  <h3 id="saas-cloud-computing-security">SaaS Cloud Computing Security</h3>
  <p>Software as a service is the topmost layer in cloud model while SaaS relies on Platform as a service to deliver services to end users. As the virtualization layer is used for good resource distribution and utilization because of multitenant behavior provided on demand. Software as a service provides many securities consideration in Web services as if refers to data security with encrypted files for confidentiality and security. Providers are responsible to protect requested applications on data centers before delivering to the cloud. Using skilled people and updating software to prevent threats from attackers. The major threats to Software as a service layer are weak credentials, insecure protocols, abusive and nefarious use of cloud computing, web-based application flaws, and malicious insiders.</p>
  <h3 id="paas-cloud-computing-security">PaaS Cloud Computing Security</h3>
  <p>Platform as a service the middle layer of cloud computing and this provides a host application to users to develop personal applications and deploy. With PaaS web applications can be constructed 5 times faster than other conventional Java or Dot NET platforms. Traditionally PaaS platforms can affect to develop enterprise applications with the responsibility of providers upgrading systems, patch management and routine maintenance. The cloud-based services on heterogeneous multi-provider which can be a challenge for providers as they utilize local machines to deploy applications. The two main security aspects which help with preventing attacks are security of PaaS platform and the application used to access and utilize additional building blocks and resources.</p>
  <h3 id="iaas-cloud-computing-security">IaaS Cloud Computing Security</h3>
  <p>The last layer of cloud computing is the virtual model which utilizes resources and isolates workloads. The users are responsible for managing policies for their resources the provider is only responsible for the infrastructure. Most cloud-based platform operate in a virtual environment, and this often leads to the software to be run on a physical infrastructure. Security control varies depending on the cloud providers any breach within the IaaS layer can affect the other layers. In the cloud environment there is a shift from the physical environment to the data center. With application security has gained increasing and being distributed to more virtual workgroups.</p>
