  <p>Through the past decade cloud computing has revolutionalized industries all over. It has allowed buisness, schools and government bodies to function at any point and time at a global scale at a better cost-to-value performance. There have been new developments with severles computing, software-defined networking, Internet of Things, and processinf netwwork edge. Up till now there have been three main service models Software as a service, Platform as a service, and Infastructure as a service.</p>

<p>##As-A-Service models
###Software</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Software as a service is known as a third party managed cloud application most commonly utilized for buisnesses. Majority of these cloud applications can be run by a web browser which doesnt require any downloads or instalations this elimnated the need for IT staff to install applications on each computer. It is also managed by the vendors and streamlines technical issue maintenance and support for the buisness. <br />
###Platform
Platform as a Service provides certain cloud componenet software used in mainly applications. The freamwork is used by developers to build upon the base or to create a customized application. The servers, storage, and networking are managed by a third party whilte the develeopers can maintaing the application. This model is simialr to Software as a service with the exception that the software is delivered over ther internet and provides a platform for software creation. The platform can be delivered by web, and developers are given freedom to build without an operating system, software updates, storage or an infastructure. 
###Infastructure
Infastructure as a service is an automated computer resource fully self-services for monitoringa dn accessing computers, networking, storage and other services. Buisnesses are allowed to purchase resources on demande as needed instead of having to buy hardware. With infrastructure as a services there are cloud serves that provide the organization a dashboard or an APi whihc gives clients control of the entire infrastructure.</p>
